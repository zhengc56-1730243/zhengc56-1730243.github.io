  	<h1>Stephen Curry wows Warriors with third straight game with eight-plus 3-pointers</h1>	
  	<p>Curry, who finished with 41 points, started slowly while picking up three early fouls, but he came to life in the third quarter, going off for 23 points and hitting seven of his eight 3-point attempts, many from far beyond the arc. When told of Curry's accomplishment, Warriors coach Steve Kerr was surprised another MVP hadn't done it first.</p>
